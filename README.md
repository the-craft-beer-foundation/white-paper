<h3>Abstract</h3>
</p>

The rules governing access to beer taps in pubs, clubs and other venues are broken. 

Major brewers use supply contracts that include exclusivity provisions and volume requirements to lock out craft 
brewers. Some contracts require venues to dedicate over 80% of beer taps to their big name brands in exchange for 
rebates, infrastructure investment and refurbishment loans. 

And some international conglomerates market their own craft-like beers. These beers, produced by giant corporations but
marketed as independent brews, are known as 'crafty beers' due to their misleading labelling.

Big brewers dominate the craft beer market. How do we stop craft breweries from being guzzled up by international 
conglomerates? How do we stop misleading labelling and marketing? What can we do to support craft brewers?

### Value Proposition

To many, blockchain is a new concept but to others blockchain is an enabler helping them to build communities and to
realise their belief in transparency, trust, and decentralisation.

We propose the Brew token as a means of exchange to be used by participants throughout the craft beer ecosystem.

The Brew platform will provide:

- <strong>Craft Beer Enthusiasts:</strong> with the ability to discover and share their favourite craft beers, craft 
  breweries, venues and events as well as a share of tokens via the platform's recognition and reward systems.
- <strong>Craft Breweries:</strong> increased revenue, information about trending craft beers, and a share of tokens.
- <strong>Venues and Events:</strong> improved customer acquisition, and a share of tokens.

### Introduction

The promise of the craft beer movement is an emphasis on quality, flavour and brewing technique.

And, in an efficient marketplace excellence should be rewarded. The best craft beer and the best craft breweries 
should receive the attention and funding they deserve.

This paper will review the current state of the craft beer marketplace and the predicament of craft breweries.
It will outline a new solution that creates a transparent and efficient Blockchain-based community for craft beer 
enthusiasts, craft breweries, venues and events, accurately valuing and rewarding their participation in the 
craft beer ecosytem.

### A New Deal

To address the challenges faced by craft breweries requires a unit of exchange and a new platform. The first phase
involves the introduction of the Brew Token. The next phase involves the development and roll-out of the Brew platform.

#### Token Technology

The Brew token, a token based on Ethereum, is an important element of a new digital community.
Ethereum is an open source, blockchain-based, distributed computing platform oriented towards smart contracts.

Effectively, Ethereum is a distributed virtual machine that allows end users to construct smart contracts for
transactions. Smart contracts are stateful applications stored in the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are
cryptographically secure and can verify or enforce performance of the contract. Token contracts are a standard feature
of the Ethereum ecosystem.
