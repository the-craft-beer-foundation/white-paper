<h3>Abstract</h3>
</p>

The rules governing access to beer taps in pubs, clubs and other venues are broken.

Major brewers use supply contracts that include exclusivity provisions and volume requirements to lock out craft
brewers. Some contracts require venues to dedicate over 80% of beer taps to their big name brands in exchange for
rebates, infrastructure investment and refurbishment loans. And large foreign-owned multinational corporations market 
their own craft-like beers seeking to co-opt craft breweries authenticity and craftiness. 

But craft beer drinkers "want to know who owns the beer they’re drinking" and "there is a strong preference for craft 
beer from independently owned breweries." [[1](#citations)] And craft beer enthusiasts don't want to be fooled into 
drinking a "fake version of a product" [[2, 3](#citations)] and there is "strong interest for a seal to identify (that) 
a beer is from an independent brewery." [[1](#citations)]

Craft breweries are losing revenue, venues aren't capturing consumers attention and craft beer enthusiasts feel 
increasingly misled.

The solution is a transparent and efficient Blockchain-based digital community. The first component is the Brew token 
and the second is the Brew platform that values and rewards users for their participation in the craft beer ecosytem.

### Value Proposition

To many, blockchain is a new concept but to others blockchain is an enabler helping them to build communities and to
realise their belief in transparency, trust, and decentralisation.

We propose the Brew token as a means of exchange to be used by participants throughout the craft beer ecosystem.

The Brew platform will provide:

- <strong>Craft Beer Enthusiasts:</strong> with the ability to learn where and how a craft beer was produced, to 
  share their favourite craft beers, craft breweries, venues and events, and a share of tokens via the platform's 
  recognition and reward system.
- <strong>Craft Breweries:</strong> increased revenue, greater customer advocacy, analytics, and a share of tokens.
- <strong>Venues and Events:</strong> increased customer attention, improved customer acquisition, and a share of tokens.

### Introduction

The promise of the craft beer movement is an emphasis on quality, flavour and brewing technique.

And, in an efficient marketplace excellence should be rewarded. The best craft beer and the best craft breweries 
should receive the attention and funding they deserve.

This paper will review the current state of the craft beer marketplace and the predicament of craft breweries.
It will outline a new solution that creates a transparent and efficient Blockchain-based community for craft beer 
enthusiasts, craft breweries, venues and events, accurately valuing and rewarding their participation in the 
craft beer ecosytem.

### A Better Deal

To address the challenges faced by craft breweries requires a unit of exchange and a new platform. The first phase
involves the introduction of the Brew token. The next phase involves the development and roll-out of the Brew platform.

#### The Brew Token

The Brew token is an ERC20 token [[4](#citations)] which will be traded on the Ethereum. 

Ethereum is an open-source, public blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system, featuring 
smart contract functionality. [[5](#citations)] Smart contracts are stateful applications stored in the Ethereum 
blockchain. They are cryptographically secure and can verify or enforce performance of the contract.

Ethereum has been used for payment systems, registries of debts or promises, distributed exchanges and crowd funding.
Big banks, tech giants, and other organisations have invested in and deployed Ethereum, including Accenture, 
Credit Suisse, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, JP Morgan and UBS. [[6](#citations)] 

#### Tokens for User Applications

Much of the development associated with the Brew App is presently code complete and hosted on the Google Cloud Platform.

</p>

The Brew platform's recognition and reward system will calculate a score based on a fixed threshold value 
(based on purchases at a craft brewery, venue or event) and a bounded score 
(based on recommendations). A summary of user behaviour will be recorded and payments made on the basis of scores. 

**Note:** A fully distributed ledger is desirable, both for public accountability and to address any scalability 
concerns. We may be able to leverage a third-party open source Ethereum micropayments system.

Recommendations may be ranked or voted on using Brew tokens, similar to the “thumbsup/thumbsdown” on many commenting 
system implementations. Comment votes backed by Brew tokens may be given more credibility due to the fact that someone
cared enough to back the comment with what would be a limited supply of token, as well as the fact that a token transfer
can be verified as coming from real people rather than robots. The right to post comments may also be purchased for 
some minimal payment, to cut down on abusive commenters.

#### Tokens for Craft Breweries, Venues and Events

The platform's recognition and reward system will calculate a score based on a fixed threshold value and a bounded score.

A lottery system may be used, where small payments are made probabilistically, with payments happening essentially 
in the same way that coin mining works with proof of participation instead of proof of work. [[7](#citations)]

#### Roadmap

- <strong>Pre 1.0 Brew Platform:</strong> Complete development of the Brew App, the Recognition and Reward system and the Brew Ledger 
and Payments system.

- <strong>1.0 Brew Platform:</strong> Launch the Brew platform.

- <strong>Beyond 1.0 Brew Platform:</strong> Brew wallet integrated with the Brew App.
