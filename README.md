### Abstract

**Brew** is a decentralized blockchain platform regulated by smart contracts. The platform seeks to promote and 
support the craft beer movement and its emphasis on quality, flavour and brewing technique.

The platform has its own ERC20 token which will be traded on the Ethereum, independently of Ether but compatible with 
any wallet, other contract or exchange also using this standard.

### Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to explain how the **Brew** platform through its use of blockchain and related 
technologies will address the many challenges faced by the craft beer movement. 

The platform will provide a [DApp](https://craftbeer.org.au/#brew) so that craft beer enthusiasts can discover and share their favourite beers, 
breweries, craft beer venues and craft beer events. Brew's recognition and reward systems will incentivise community 
members and inspire new participants.

Developers will be encouraged to use the platform's open-source APIs and SDKs to create innovative (disruptive and 
unique) products and services. 

**Note:** The project was bootstrapped by the Craft Beer Foundation, a non-profit organisation.
