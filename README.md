<h3>Abstract</h3>
</p>

The rules governing access to beer taps in pubs, clubs and other venues are broken. 

Major brewers use supply contracts that include exclusivity provisions and volume requirements to lock out craft brewers.

Some contracts require venues to dedicate over 80% of beer taps to their big name brands in exchange for rebates,
infrastructure investment and refurbishment loans. And some international conglomerates market their own craft-like 
beers. These beers, produced by giant corporations but marketed as independent brews, are known as 'crafty beers' due 
to their misleading labelling.

Big brewers dominate the craft beer market. How do we stop craft brewers from being guzzled up by international 
conglomerates? How do we stop misleading labelling and marketing? What can we do to support craft brewers?

### Value Proposition

To many, blockchain is a new concept but to others blockchain is an enabler helping them to build communities and to
realise their belief in transparency, trust, and decentralisation.

We propose the BREW token as a means of exchange to be used by participants throughout the craft beer ecosystem.

The BREW platform will provide:

- Craft Beer Enthusiasts: with the ability to discover and share their favourite craft beers, craft breweries, 
  craft beer venues and craft beer events as well as a share of tokens via the platform's recognition and reward systems.
- Craft Breweries: increased revenue, information about trending beers, and a share of tokens.
- Craft Venues: improved customer acquisition, and a share of tokens
